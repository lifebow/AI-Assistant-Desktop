Build a chrome extension. When user selectet text, either trigger by context menu or predefined keyboard shortcut, open a popup showing the selected text, a textarea for user to input additional instructions, and a submit button. User can also select predefined instructions that they setup on the config page (like "translate to english" or "fact check"). On submit, send the selected text along with the instructions to an API endpoint and display the response in the popup. The extension must support key management (can store multiple API keys securely and select random one to use), custom base URL, predefine for openai compatible, google ai stuido, anthoropic, openrouter. The UI must look modern and clean, with proper error handling and loading states.
